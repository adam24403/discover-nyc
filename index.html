<h1>Landmarks</h1>
<h2>The Empire State Building</h2>
<p>
   Seen from multiple viewpoints throughout the city, the Empire State Building is one of the most notable NY landmarks. You’ll find it standing proudly – since 1931 – in Midtown Manhattan. 
   It’s hard not to miss this imposing 102-story Art Deco skyscraper, so why not get close up to see the building in its full towering glory? 
   Travel to the 86th floor for a bird’s eye view of the city. The journey to the top of this historic building is memorable enough itself, with an elevator ride that whisks visitors up 1,250 feet in just 60 seconds
   Now, I’ll be totally honest – if you have to choose between going to the top of the Rockefeller and the Empire State, I’d opt for the Top of the Rock (more on that in a mo), but the views from the Empire State Building are pretty epic. 
</p>
<h2>Central Park</h2>
<p>
    If you’ve seen movies like Elf, Home Alone 2, John Wick or Ghostbusters, you know about Central Park. Even if you haven’t, you know about Central Park. 
    To say the park is massive is an understatement – it spans about 840 acres (340 hectares), making it larger than some countries (Monaco, I’m looking at you). And to see it all, you would probably need an entire week to cover it alone. 
    But that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t try. While you can visit the park simply for its cultural significance, there are endless fun things to do. From sports pitches, Central Park Zoo, yoga and fitness classes, concerts and many other attractions. 
    Central Park also features several lakes and ponds, where you can rent rowboats or take a peaceful gondola ride. Take my advice and rent a bike to zip around the park with ease.
</p>
<h2>The Statue of Liberty</h2>
<p>
    The Statue of Liberty is hands down the most famous landmark in New York, symbolising the freedom and enlightenment that’s at the heart of the American dream. 
    The distinguished mint-green figure is often the first thing travellers glimpse when arriving at JFK airport, but it’s hard not to be wowed when you finally see Lady Liberty in the flesh. 
    Visit this colossal copper sculpture on Liberty Island via this sightseeing cruise around the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island.  
</p>
<h2>Times Square</h2>
    <p>Is there anywhere quite as chaotically wonderful as Times Square? 
        This famous New York landmark is home to bustling theatres along Broadway, in the Theatre District and Lincoln Centre. Come here to catch award-winning plays, films and musicals that take place throughout the year. 
        However, Time Square has the most electrifying atmosphere during New Year’s Eve and other annual festivities like stand-up comedies, dance parties, concerts and cultural events. 
        Even if you’re not there for the celebration, the buzzing energy, massive billboards, signs, and overall appearance is makes for a unique experience.
